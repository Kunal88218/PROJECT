                        <h4>1. Choose the Right Test: SAT vs. ACT</h4>
                        <p>Take a **full-length practice test** of both the SAT and ACT early on. Analyze which test format, pacing, and subject distribution (especially the ACT's science section) best suits your natural strengths.</p>

                        <h4>2. Create a Study Schedule (6-8 Weeks)</h4>
                        <p>Don't cram. Dedicate **45–60 minutes, 3–4 times per week**, focusing on your weakest sections first. Reserve the final two weeks for full-length, timed practice tests to build endurance.</p>

                        <h4>3. Learn the Pacing Strategy</h4>
                        <p>Time management is crucial. Know exactly how much time you have per question for each section. **Never leave an answer blank** (since there is no penalty for guessing on the SAT or ACT), but don't linger too long on tough questions.</p>

                        <h4>4. Review Your Mistakes Religiously</h4>
                        <p>The biggest prep mistake is just taking tests without learning from them. Keep an **"Error Log"** where you analyze why you got a question wrong, then practice similar problems until you master the concept.</p>
